    \n\n I love eating noddles.
    \n\n I play guitar and sometimes sketching.
    \n\n I also read books.
    \n\n I am good at UX part of it.
    \n\n I am learning android development and kotlin for upgrading my skill.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
